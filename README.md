· Using React Native, create a well designed input box in a mobile app where users can type their search.

· Display suggestions which a user can pick from a displayed drop down. Suggestions should be fetched and displayed while typing and also when the user focuses on the input box. The suggestions should hide on click out.

· Selecting a suggestion should update the input box with the suggestion, and automatically add a space at the end to allow quick typing.

· Highlight text in the suggestion that matches the current word being typed in the input box. matching text.
